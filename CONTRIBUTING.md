# Contributing

First, it is awesome that you are considering contributing to Kubescape! Contributing is important and fun and we welcome your efforts.

When contributing, we categorize contributions into two:
* Small code changes or fixes, whose scope are limited to a single or two files
* Complex features and improvements, whose are not limited

If you have a small change, feel free to fire up a Pull Request.

When planning a bigger change, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Most likely your changes or features are great, but sometimes we might already going to this direction (or the exact opposite ;-) ) and we don't want to waste your time.
